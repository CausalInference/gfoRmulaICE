Description: Implements the parametric g-formula iterative conditional estimator (ICE) algorithms. 
    The ICE estimator can be used to estimate the causal effects of time-varying 
    treatment interventions on risk of a survival outcome from longitudinal data with 
    time-varying confounding. 
    The package supports 1) both singly robust and doubly robust estimators; 
    2) static, dynamic, deterministic, stochastic, and threshold interventions; 3) censoring event; 
    4) competing event; 5) user-defined intervention strategies.
