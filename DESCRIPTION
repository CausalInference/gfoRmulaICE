Package: gfoRmulaICE
Type: Package
Title: ICE
Version: 0.1.0
Description: Implements iterative conditional expectation (ICE) estimators of the plug-in g-formula. 
    Both singly robust and doubly robust ICE estimators based on parametric models are available. 
    The package can be used to estimate survival curves under sustained treatment strategies (interventions) using longitudinal data with time-varying treatments, time-varying confounders, censoring, and competing events.
    The interventions can be static or dynamic, and deterministic or stochastic (including threshold interventions). Both prespecified and user-defined interventions are available.
